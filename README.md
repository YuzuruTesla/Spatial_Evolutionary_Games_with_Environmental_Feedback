# Spatial_Evolutionary_Games_with_Environmental_Feedback

This repository accompanies the preprint "Spatial Pattern Formation in Eco-Evolutionary Games with Environment-Driven Motion",by Tianyong Yao and Daniel B. Cooney. It will include all of the scripts used to generate the figures in the paper. It includes all of the scripts used to generate all of the figures in the paper.

The repository is organized into three folders: Scripts, Figures, and Simulation Outputs. All of the scripts can be run using MATLAB_R2024a.

For reference, below is a list of figures and the scripts that were used to generate each figure.

- Figure 1: Run chi_u_m.m
- Figure 2: Run chi_u_Dv_di.m
- Figure 3: Run Verify_f_LH_heatmap.m
- Figure 4: Run pi_LH_x_close.m
- Figure 5: Run pi_LH_x_far.m
- Figure 6(a): Run chi_u_pi_save.m to generate the data file average_f_LH.csv and figure. Alternatively, run file_chi_u_pi.m with the average_f_LH.csv file to produce the figure.
- Figure 6(b): Run chi_u_uv_save.m to generate the data file average_uv.csv and figure. Alternatively, run file_chi_u_uv.m with the average_uv.csv file to produce the figure.
- Figure 6(c): Run chi_u_n_save.m to generate the data file average_n.csv and figure. Alternatively, run file_chi_u_n.m with the average_n.csv file to produce the figure.
- Figure 7(a): Run max_chi_u.m to generate the data file average_max_f_LH.csv and figure. Alternatively, run file_max_f_LH.m with the average_max_f_LH.csv file to produce the figure.
- Figure 7(b): Run max_chi_u.m to generate the data file average_max_uv.csv and figure. Alternatively, run file_max_uv.m with the average_max_uv.csv file to produce the figure.
- Figure 7(c): Run max_chi_u.m to generate the data file average_max_n.csv and figure. Alternatively, run file_max_n.m with the average_max_n.csv file to produce the figure.
- Figure 7(d): Run max_chi_u_small.m to generate the data file average_max_f_small.csv and figure. Alternatively, run file_max_fLH_small.m with the average_max_f_small.csv file to produce the figure.
- Figure 8(a): Run meta.m
- Figure 8(b): Run meta_heatmap.m
